#' **Part One**
#'
#' 
#' A giant [whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale) has decided
#' your submarine is its next meal, and it\'s much faster than you are.
#' There\'s nowhere to run!
#' 
#' Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it\'s too
#' deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be
#' preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a
#' *massive underground cave system* just beyond where they\'re aiming!
#' 
#' The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they\'ll have enough
#' power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through.
#' However, it doesn\'t look like they\'ll be aligned before the whale
#' catches you! Maybe you can help?
#' 
#' There\'s one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.
#' 
#' You quickly make a list of *the horizontal position of each crab* (your
#' puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a
#' way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them
#' to spend as little fuel as possible.
#' 
#' For example, consider the following horizontal positions:
#' 
#'     16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14
#' 
#' This means there\'s a crab with horizontal position `16`, a crab with
#' horizontal position `1`, and so on.
#' 
#' Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1
#' fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but
#' the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position `2`:
#' 
#' -   Move from `16` to `2`: `14` fuel
#' -   Move from `1` to `2`: `1` fuel
#' -   Move from `2` to `2`: `0` fuel
#' -   Move from `0` to `2`: `2` fuel
#' -   Move from `4` to `2`: `2` fuel
#' -   Move from `2` to `2`: `0` fuel
#' -   Move from `7` to `2`: `5` fuel
#' -   Move from `1` to `2`: `1` fuel
#' -   Move from `2` to `2`: `0` fuel
#' -   Move from `14` to `2`: `12` fuel
#' 
#' This costs a total of `37` fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome;
#' more expensive outcomes include aligning at position `1` (`41` fuel),
#' position `3` (`39` fuel), or position `10` (`71` fuel).
#' 
#' Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the
#' least fuel possible. *How much fuel must they spend to align to that
#' position?*
