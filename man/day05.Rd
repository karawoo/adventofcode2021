\strong{Part One}

You come across a field of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent}{hydrothermal vents} on the ocean
floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would
be best to avoid them if possible.

They tend to form in \emph{lines}; the submarine helpfully produces a list of
nearby [lines of vents]{title="Maybe they're Bresenham vents."} (your
puzzle input) for you to review. For example:\preformatted{0,9 -> 5,9
8,0 -> 0,8
9,4 -> 3,4
2,2 -> 2,1
7,0 -> 7,4
6,4 -> 2,0
0,9 -> 2,9
3,4 -> 1,4
0,0 -> 8,8
5,5 -> 8,2
}

Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format
\verb{x1,y1 -> x2,y2} where \code{x1},\code{y1} are the coordinates of one end the line
segment and \code{x2},\code{y2} are the coordinates of the other end. These line
segments include the points at both ends. In other words:
\itemize{
\item An entry like \verb{1,1 -> 1,3} covers points \verb{1,1}, \verb{1,2}, and \verb{1,3}.
\item An entry like \verb{9,7 -> 7,7} covers points \verb{9,7}, \verb{8,7}, and \verb{7,7}.
}

For now, \emph{only consider horizontal and vertical lines}: lines where
either \code{x1 = x2} or \code{y1 = y2}.

So, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce
the following diagram:\preformatted{.......1..
..1....1..
..1....1..
.......1..
.112111211
..........
..........
..........
..........
222111....
}

In this diagram, the top left corner is \verb{0,0} and the bottom right
corner is \verb{9,9}. Each position is shown as \emph{the number of lines which
cover that point} or \code{.} if no line covers that point. The top-left pair
of \code{1}s, for example, comes from \verb{2,2 -> 2,1}; the very bottom row is
formed by the overlapping lines \verb{0,9 -> 5,9} and \verb{0,9 -> 2,9}.

To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine \emph{the number of
points where at least two lines overlap}. In the above example, this is
anywhere in the diagram with a \code{2} or larger - a total of \code{5} points.

Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. \emph{At how many points do at
least two lines overlap?}
