\strong{Part One}

The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this
way?

A massive school of glowing
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish}{lanternfish} swims past.
They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe
\emph{exponentially} quickly? You should model their growth rate to be sure.

Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish,
you make some guesses about their attributes. Surely, [each lanternfish
creates a new lanternfish]{title="I heard you like lanternfish."} once
every \emph{7} days.

However, this process isn\'t necessarily synchronized between every
lanternfish - one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates
another lanternfish, while another might have 4. So, you can model each
fish as a single number that represents \emph{the number of days until it
creates a new lanternfish}.

Furthermore, you reason, a \emph{new} lanternfish would surely need slightly
longer before it\'s capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days
for its first cycle.

So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of \code{3}:
\itemize{
\item After one day, its internal timer would become \code{2}.
\item After another day, its internal timer would become \code{1}.
\item After another day, its internal timer would become \code{0}.
\item After another day, its internal timer would reset to \code{6}, and it
would create a \emph{new} lanternfish with an internal timer of \code{8}.
\item After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal
timer of \code{5}, and the second lanternfish would have an internal
timer of \code{7}.
}

A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to \code{6}, \emph{not \code{7}}
(because \code{0} is included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish
starts with an internal timer of \code{8} and does not start counting down
until the next day.

Realizing what you\'re trying to do, the submarine automatically
produces a list of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your
puzzle input). For example, suppose you were given the following list:\preformatted{3,4,3,1,2
}

This list means that the first fish has an internal timer of \code{3}, the
second fish has an internal timer of \code{4}, and so on until the fifth
fish, which has an internal timer of \code{2}. Simulating these fish over
several days would proceed as follows:\preformatted{Initial state: 3,4,3,1,2
After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1
After  2 days: 1,2,1,6,0,8
After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8
After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8
After  5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8
After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7
After  7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6
After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5
After  9 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8
After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8
After 11 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,7,8,8,8
After 12 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,0,0,1,5,6,7,7,7,8,8
After 13 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,0,4,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8
After 14 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
After 15 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7
After 16 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,8
After 17 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8
After 18 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,6,7,8,8,8,8
}

Each day, a \code{0} becomes a \code{6} and adds a new \code{8} to the end of the list,
while each other number decreases by 1 if it was present at the start of
the day.

In this example, after 18 days, there are a total of \code{26} fish. After 80
days, there would be a total of \code{5934}.

Find a way to simulate lanternfish. \emph{How many lanternfish would there be
after 80 days?}
