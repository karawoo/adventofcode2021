\details{
\strong{Part One}

You\'re minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard
alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the
Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the
ocean!

Before you know it, you\'re inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for
situations like this. It\'s covered in Christmas lights (because of
course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be
able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough;
there\'s a little meter that indicates the antenna\'s signal strength by
displaying 0-50 \emph{stars}.

Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you\'ll need to
get all \emph{fifty stars} by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
complete the first. Each puzzle grants \emph{one star}. Good luck!

As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically
performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the
sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a
measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and
further away from the submarine.

For example, suppose you had the following report:\preformatted{199
200
208
210
200
207
240
269
260
263
}

This report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the
sonar sweep found depths of \code{199}, \code{200}, \code{208}, \code{210}, and so on.

The first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth
increases, just so you know what you\'re dealing with - you never know
if the keys will get [carried into deeper
water]{title="Does this premise seem fishy to you?"} by an ocean current
or a fish or something.

To do this, count \emph{the number of times a depth measurement increases}
from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first
measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:\preformatted{199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
200 (increased)
208 (increased)
210 (increased)
200 (decreased)
207 (increased)
240 (increased)
269 (increased)
260 (decreased)
263 (increased)
}

In this example, there are \emph{\code{7}} measurements that are larger than the
previous measurement.

\emph{How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?}

\strong{Part Two}

Your goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this
sliding window increases from the previous sum. So, compare A with B, then
compare B with C, then C with D, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough
measurements left to create a new three-measurement sum.
