\details{
\strong{Part One}

The submarine has been making some [odd creaking
noises]{title="Turns out oceans are heavy."}, so you ask it to produce a
diagnostic report just in case.

The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary
numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things
about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is
the \emph{power consumption}.

You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate
two new binary numbers (called the \emph{gamma rate} and the \emph{epsilon rate}).
The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by
the epsilon rate.

Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the \emph{most common
bit in the corresponding position} of all numbers in the diagnostic
report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\preformatted{00100
11110
10110
10111
10101
01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
}

Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five \code{0} bits
and seven \code{1} bits. Since the most common bit is \code{1}, the first bit of
the gamma rate is \code{1}.

The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is
\code{0}, so the second bit of the gamma rate is \code{0}.

The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are \code{1}, \code{1},
and \code{0}, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are
\code{110}.

So, the gamma rate is the binary number \code{10110}, or \code{22} in decimal.

The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the
most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So,
the epsilon rate is \code{01001}, or \code{9} in decimal. Multiplying the gamma
rate (\code{22}) by the epsilon rate (\code{9}) produces the power consumption,
\code{198}.

Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma
rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. \emph{What is the power
consumption of the submarine?} (Be sure to represent your answer in
decimal, not binary.)
